LinkenLog is a tradeskill link tracker.  It will automatically exchange links with other LL users, track your alts' tradeskills, and monitor guild chat for links.

LL can be accessed via its LDB launcher or the command @/linken@.  Links listed with a red date are from a previous patch and may not be accurate.
